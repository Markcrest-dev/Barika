## Mobile Optimization

For optimal performance on mobile devices, the website uses separate, resized background images specifically designed for smaller screens:

- Desktop images are stored in the `Images/` directory
- Mobile-optimized images are stored in the `Images/mobile/` directory
- Media queries automatically switch between image sets based on screen size
- This approach reduces bandwidth usage and improves loading times on mobile devices
